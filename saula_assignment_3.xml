        <Verse_1>
            Load the car and write the note
            Grab your bag and grab your coat
            Tell the ones that need to know
            We are headed north
        </Verse_1>
        <Chorus>
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
            Are you aware the shape I'm in?
            My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
        </Chorus>
        <Verse_2>
            When at first I learned to speak
            I used all my words to fight
            With him and her and you and me
            Oh, but it's just a waste of time
            It's such a waste of time
            That woman she's got eyes that shine
            Like a pair of stolen polished dimes
            She asked to dance I said it's fine
            I'll see you in the morning time
        </Verse_2>
        <Chorus>
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
            Are you aware the shape I'm in?
            My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
        </Chorus>
        <Bridge>
            Three words that became hard to say
            I and love and you
            What you were then, I am today
            Look at the things I do
        </Bridge>
        <Chorus>
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
            Are you aware the shape I'm in?
            My hands, they shake, my head, it spins
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
        </Chorus>
        <Chorusx2>
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
            Are you aware the shape I'm in? (Oh!)
            My hands, they shake, my head, it spins (spins)
            Oh Brooklyn, Brooklyn take me in
        </Chorusx2>
        <Outro>
            Dumbed down and numbed by time and age
            The dreams the catch, the world the cage
            The highway sets the traveler's stage
            All exits look the same
            Three words that became hard to say
            I and love and you x3
        </Outro>
